CSS levels
cascading style sheets does not have a traditional version,instead it has levels.each level builds on the
previous ,refining definitions and add features.the feature of high level is a superset of any low level.

CSS Level 1
the CSS Working Group consider the CSS1 specification as obsolete.CSS Level 1 is defined as all the features
defined in the CSS1 specification (properties, values, at-rules, etc), but using the syntax and definitions
in the CSS2.1 specification. CSS Style Attributes defines its inclusion in element-specific style attributes.

CSS Level 2
the CSS 2 is the W3C recommendation.
Features in CSS2 that were dropped from CSS2.1 should be considered to be at the Candidate Recommendation
stage, but note that many of these have been or will be pulled into a CSS Level 3 working draft, in which
case that specification will, once it reaches CR, obsolete the definitions in CSS2.

CSS Level 3
CSS 3 builds on CSS level 2 module by module.using the CSS 2.1 specification as its core.Each adds functionality
and/or replace part of the CSS 2.1 specification.the CSS Working Group intend that the new CSS modules will
not contradict the CSS2.1 specification:only that they will add functionality and redefine specification.
As each module is completed,it will be plugged into the existing system of CSS2.1 plus previous-completed modules.

From this level on modules are levelled independently.

CSS Level 4 and beyond
there in no CSS Level 4.Independent modules can reach level 4 or beyond.but CSS language no longer has levels.
("CSS Level 3" as a term is used only to differentiate it from the previous monolithic versions.)
